          in a set of service calls.</p>
        <h3 id="default-theme">Default Theme</h3>
        <p>A compiled version of the default theme is located at the following:</p>
        <pre class="pc-prism">@pioneer-code/pioneer-charts/
  |-  dist/styles
  |   |-  pioneer-code-pioneer-charts.css
  |   |-  pioneer-code-pioneer-charts.css.map
  |   |-  pioneer-code-pioneer-charts.min.css
  |   |-  pioneer-code-pioneer-charts.min.css.map</pre>
        <h3 id="sass">Sass</h3>
        <p>If you prefer adding the default theme to your project through a Sass build, you need to make reference to the root
          Pioneer Chart Sass file in your project like so.</p>
        <pc-prism language="typescript" [code]="importStylesCode"></pc-prism>
        <h3 id="customize">Customize</h3>
        <p>Styling for Pioneer Charts takes place at two different levels. The first being css and the second being through
          code. The need to do align styling across css and javascript comes from the dynamic nature styles are applied through
          <a href="https://d3js.org/" title="D3">D3</a>.
        </p>
        <h5 id="css">Css</h5>
        <p>Much like before, you are going to want to import the Pioneer Chart Sass code into your code. The difference being
          you will want to override Pioneer Chart variables at the same time.</p>
        <pc-prism language="typescript" [code]="importStylesCodeOverride"></pc-prism>
        <p>For a full reference of variables, you can look at the default theme import file locate at the following:</p>
        <pre class="pc-prism">@pioneer-code/pioneer-charts/src/styles/core/theme/imports.scss</pre>
        <h5 id="javascript">Javascript</h5>
